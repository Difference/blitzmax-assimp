#summary How to download and compile

= Introduction =

In order to use this module, you need to download and compile it


= Details =

Create a folder called  scheutz.mod in  the \\YOUR Blitzmax PATH\mod\ directory

SVN checkout to a subfolder called assimp.mod

You structure should then look like this:

\\YOUR Blitzmax PATH\mod\scheutz.mod\assimp.mod

assimp itself and boost are also downloaded as external svn's when you checkout this module, so you should *include externs* when you it check out

When it's checked out, you need to "build modules" and then try out the sample from the examples folder.

To run the test program, you need minib3D from http://blitzmax.com/Community/posts.php?topic=65370 , but yuo can use the module without minib3d
